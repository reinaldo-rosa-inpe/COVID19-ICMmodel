# COVID19-ICMmodel
This a code based on the ICM-Model introduced by Rosa at al. (2020) which has as input: (i) the general transmission control factor g (0.5 &lt; g &lt; 1); (ii)the value of daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19. The model has been validated by using the data from WHO. The output is the expected range (min-max) and respective daily derivative,  when there is spike positive derivative for the next day. From the derivatices of N and g is it possible to estimate de suppression factor s(delta_g, delta_N).
